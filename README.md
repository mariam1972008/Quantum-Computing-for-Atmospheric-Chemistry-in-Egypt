# Project Overview
 # -------------------------------------
#
 # This project was developed to participate in the Quantum AI Hackathon. The project addresses the problem of air pollution in the Nile Delta, specifically the formation of sulfate aerosols.
The problem tackled is that the Nile Delta is characterized by very high humidity (exceeding 80%) year-round. This high humidity accelerates the formation of sulfate aerosols resulting from industrial emissions.
To address this challenge, Team 2-atmospheric_chem performed a quantum simulation of how humidity affects the chemical reaction chain that leads to the formation of these particles. 
By taking this approach, the team combined classical and quantum AI methodologies to tackle this important environmental challenge ."
