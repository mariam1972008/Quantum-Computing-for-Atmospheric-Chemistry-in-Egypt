# Project Overview
 # -------------------------------------
#
 # This project was developed to participate in the Quantum AI Hackathon. The project addresses the problem of air pollution in the Nile Delta, specifically the formation of sulfate aerosols.
The problem tackled is that the Nile Delta is characterized by very high humidity (exceeding 80%) year-round. This high humidity accelerates the formation of sulfate aerosols resulting from industrial emissions.
To address this challenge, Team 2-atmospheric_chem performed a quantum simulation of how humidity affects the chemical reaction chain that leads to the formation of these particles. 
By taking this approach, the team combined classical and quantum AI methodologies to tackle this important environmental challenge ."

 # Responsible Team Member: Mariam Khaled
 This project uses a hybrid quantum-classical model to simulate the reaction pathway for:

SO₃ + nH₂O → H₂SO₄ (n = 1–3)

1. Purpose of the Quantum Model

Compute reaction pathway energy surfaces (PES) using quantum methods.

Calculate ΔE (reaction energy differences) for each cluster size .

Map these quantum results to reaction rate predictions and aerosol nucleation probabilities.


2. Quantum Methods

VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) was used to compute the ground state electronic energy of each molecular configuration.

Qiskit Nature was used to:

Generate the electronic structure problem from molecular coordinates.

Map fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit Hamiltonians (Jordan–Wigner mapping).

Optimize the variational circuit to get the lowest energy.


Results are combined with classical molecular geometry optimization to construct the PES.


3. Workflow

1. Generate molecular coordinates for SO₃ + nH₂O clusters (optimized classically).


2. Compute ground-state energy of reactants and products with VQE.


3. Calculate ΔE = E_products – E_reactants for each step of the pathway.


4. Feed ΔE into a classical kinetic model to estimate reaction probabilities.
